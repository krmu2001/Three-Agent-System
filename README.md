# Three-Agent-System
This is an implementation of a system consisting of three separate agents, all powered by a Large Language Model.

## Agent 1 (Dilemma Generator):
This agent is responsible for creating a dilemma. The dilemma can be about any topic (e.g, ethics, politics, philosophy, worldviews, etc.), but it must clearly present two opposing or clashing viewpoints.

## Agent 2 and Agent 3 (Advocates):
Each of these agents independently selects one of the two viewpoints presented by Agent 1.
Their task is to expand upon and defend their chosen position, constructing a well-reasoned and coherent argument explaining why that viewpoint is the correct or preferable one.

## Optional Extension (Debate Mode):
As a bonus feature, the two advocate agents then engage in a dialogue-based debate, responding to each other’s arguments and counterarguments in a back-and-forth format.

The goal of this setup is to explore how multiple LLM-driven agents can generate, reason about, and debate complex topics in a structured way.
